# Real-time-Object-Detection-with-YOLO
###### This project implements real-time object detection on a live RTSP video stream using YOLOv8, sourced from an Android camera via the IP Webcam app. It identifies multiple people, assigning each a unique, randomly colored bounding box while avoiding red shades. Users can interact by clicking a box to turn it red and start a timer, with tracking to maintain the red color even if detection is momentarily lost. Selecting a new person resets the timer and changes the previous box back to a random color.
